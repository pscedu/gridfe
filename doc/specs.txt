Portal Specifications
Robert Budden, Jared Yanovich

Below are our proposed specifications for a grid-savvy Web portal.
The purpose of this portal will be to allow grid users to login and
perform all the commonly used features of the Globus toolkit from
anywhere on the Internet.  This portal will be designed primarily
so that minimal knowledge of technical detail on behalf of the grid
user is required.  This will be accomplished through a powerful yet
simplistic graphical Web interface.

Code will be written in Java, C, HTML.

GridFE will require database capabilities for storage through any
JDBC-enabled RDBMS, such as MySQL.
