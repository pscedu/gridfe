About mod_fum
=============
mod_fum (functional user Machiavellianism between Apache/Kerberos/KX509)
was specifically designed for use with Grid Portal software.  The
purpose was to provide the functionality of the command line tools
kinit(1), kx509(1), and kxlist(1) from within Apache.  mod_fum obtains a
Kerberos ticket along with a short term X.509 certificate for the user.
These credentials are specific to the user but readable only by Apache
(or whomever the Apache Web server runs as).  This allows Web
applications such as portals to act on the user's behalf.

Note: mod_fum should only be used in conjunction with mod_ssl!
Otherwise Kerberos passwords will be transmitted in cleartext.

mod_fum Installation
====================

Requirements:
  1) Apache 2.X
  2) Kerberos 5
  3) libkx509
	When building KX509, the configuration option --enable-libkx509
	must be used.  mod_fum relies on the shared library libkx509.so
	to be in LD_LIBRARY_PATH or properly installed.  The KX509
	distribution does not provide make targets for installing
	libkx509.so, and so this installation must be installed manually:

	  # cp libkx509.so /usr/lib
	  # ldconfig

	Note: The KX509 header file kx509.h must also be present on the
	system to build mod_fum.

Building mod_fum:
=================
Standard 'make/make install' combo.

Apache Configuration:
=====================
1) Add the following to the <Directory> tags in 'httpd.conf' file
to enable mod_fum-style authentication:

	# mod_fum Authentication Requirements
	AuthName "GridFe Login"
	AuthType Basic
	SetHandler mod_fum_auth
	Require Valid-User

	# Use this for mod_ssl support (recommended)
	SSLRequireSSL
	SSLProtocol all -SSLv2
