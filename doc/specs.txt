Portal Specifications
Robert Budden, Jared Yanovich

Below are our proposed specifications for a grid-savvy Web portal.
The purpose of this portal will be to allow grid users to login and
perform all the commonly used features of the globus toolkit from any
Internet connected computer.  This portal will be designed primarily
so that minimal knowledge of technical detail is required.  This will
be accomplished through a powerful, yet simplistic graphical interface.

List of technologies used:
	1) Programming languages: Java, C, HTML
	2) Database option: MySQL

List of proposed portal features:
	1) Logins – handle the login of users through a clean and
	   concise Web interface
	2) Certificate and proxy management – handle grid
	   authentication
	3) Status – current status of jobs and list of previously
	   completed jobs
	4) Run job – interface to globus-job-run(1)
	5) Schedule job – interface to globus-job-submit(1)
	6) Collect job output – interface to globus-job-get-output(1)
	7) Maintenance – allow maintenance of grid-mapfile including
	   addition & deletion of entries, and consistency checks.
	8) Machine status – view a list of machines/nodes currently
	   on the grid and their current status
	9) Daemon/service status – view of what services are currently
	   running (MDS, GRAM, GridFTP, etc...)
	10) Possible side portal for advanced administration of the
	    above
