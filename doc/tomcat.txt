How to setup GridFE under Tomcat
================================

Overview
========

There are several ways to setup Tomcat to serve GridFE, an ability that
most servlets support:

(1) Tomcat runs standalone.  Under this mode, Tomcat listens on a
    port that Web browsers connect to directly.
(2) Apache delegates special requests to Tomcat.  Apache must be
    be configured to acknowledge such requests, and is done so through
    a "connector."

Tomcat must be made known of the GridFE root, which is done so through
a "context" (and must be so, else it would only work in standalone
mode).

File					Edit	Description
===============================================================================
/etc/tomcat/web.xml				Web-related configuration
/etc/tomcat/server.xml			*	Server-related configuration
/etc/sysconfig/tomcat				System-related configuration
/etc/init.d/tomcat				Tomcat execution control
/usr/share/tomcat				Tomcat general home
/var/www/gridfe					GridFE base
/var/www/gridfe/WEB-INF/web.xml		*	GridFE servlet configuration
/var/lib/tomcat					Tomcat Web home
/etc/httpd/conf/workers2.properties	*	Tomcat connector configuration

Details
=======
There are severals implications of running Tomcat as either a standalone
or runner service.  If SSL is being used and Tomcat is running standalone,
it must handle SSL itself; whereas if Tomcat is set up as a runner service
under Apache, Apache can handle SSL duties and let Tomcat and the applications
it hosts worry about something other than SSL encryption/decryption.

To configure the Tomcat servlet runner service through Apache, add the
following to /etc/httpd/conf/workers2.properties:

	========================================================================
	[uri:/gridfe]
	info=Grid Front End
	context=/gridfe
	debug=0

	[uri:/gridfe/*]
	info=Map all of GridFE
	========================================================================

Next, configure Tomcat to acknowledge GridFE, specified in
/etc/tomcat/server.xml:

	========================================================================
	<Context path="/gridfe" docBase="gridfe" debug="0" reloadable="true"
	 crossContext="true">
	  <Logger className="com.redhat.tomcat.Logger" filename="gridfe.log"
	   timestamp="true"/>
	</Context>
	========================================================================

Since this will be inside the encompassing <Host> element, the `docBase' will
be relative to `Host appBase', so a symbolic link (or something) must be
created to point from the appBase to the real GridFE root location.

Apache Configuration
====================
The mod_jk2 Apache module must be activated.  This provides the communication
between Apache and Tomcat, using the configuration specified worker2.properties.

Sample Apache configuration to require SSL for GridFE for encrypted
communication:

LoadModule fum_module modules/mod_fum.so
LoadModule jk2_module modules/mod_jk2.so

<Location "/gridfe/gridfe">
        AuthName "GridFE Login"
        AuthType Fum
        Require valid-user
        SSLRequireSSL
</Location>
