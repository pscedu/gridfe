Note:  this information applies to CoG for GT4.
For development, cog-4.1.3 was used.

1) Copy lib/cog-jglobus-* to lib/gt4_0_0.  This contains some
   packages which are no longer used in CoG/gt4 but still used
   by GridFE.

2) Adjust GridFE lib/mk/defs.mk so that the following archives
   are placed into the class path:

        lib/gt4_0_0/cog-jglobus.jar
        lib/puretls.jar
        lib/commons-logging.jar
        lib/cryptix32.jar
        lib/cryptix-asn1.jar
        lib/jce-jdk13-125.jar
