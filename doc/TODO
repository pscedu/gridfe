	- should be the command "SSLProtocol all -SSLv2" but figure
	  out where it goes (this should be a real quick fix)

- Add timestamp to submitted jobs.
- Add job submission example suite/guide
- load rsl for job submit option

overview/index page
- where to go for what to do (tutorial pages)

misc
- move to jmk (java make) or even ant
- move MKDEP from defs.mk to local.mk
- job get output both stdout and stderr, not just stdout
- rename database field "host type" to "host gridftp type"

- XXX MAJOR TODO
- see if kx509 can generate a full certificate from an undelegated gssapi
  auth credential (obtained from "negotiate auth" mechanism) with konqueror
  you cannot change the delegation parameter to gss_init_sec_context()

- fix ClassNotFoundException: gridfe.www.t
  when requesting gridfe.psc.edu/gridfe/gridfe/t

- revamp buildURL -- take an array of query string params which
  all get URL-escaped, use & instead of &amp;, and make sure resulting
  URLs are always HTML-escaped when being written to a page.
