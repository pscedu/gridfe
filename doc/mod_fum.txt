mod_fum Installation
====================

Requirements:
=============
1) Apache 2.X
2) Kerberos 5
3) kx509
	When building kx509 the configuration option
	--enable-libkx509 must be used.  mod_fum relies on the shared
	library libkx509.so to be in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or for libkx509.so
	to be properly installed, which the kx509 distribution does not
	provide installation targets for, and must be installed
	manually:

	# cp libkx509.so /usr/lib
	# ldconfig

	The kx509 header file 'kx509.h' must also be present on the system
	to build mod fum.



Building mod_fum:
=================
1) Type: 'make' to compile the module
2) Then: 'make install' to compile & install (using apsx) into apache
3) And: 'make clean' to remove extra stuff






Apache Configuration:
=====================
1) Add the following to your <Directory> tag in your 'httpd.conf' file:

	AuthName "GridFe Login"
	AuthType Basic
	SetHandler mod_fum_auth
	Require Valid-User

	# Use this for mod_ssl support (recommended!!)
	SSLRequireSSL
	SSLProtocol all -SSLv2
