TODO
1) ap_uname2id(char *) - use this to obtain user id?

X) mf_get_uid_from_ticket_cache really isn't needed... we could
	save the uid from what we got from passwd, but for now
	just keep this in case code gets switched later, we don't
	have to rely on anything except the ticket cache name.

XXX Development Notes:
1) currently only users with user account can use authenticate.
	mod_fum requires a uid lookup from /etc/passwd to write
	the X.509 certificates in /tmp.

2) Apache 2.X series support only! (1.X could be added, but is
	currently not needed for this project) Version 1.X changed
	enough functions, data types, etc. that it was not worth
	the time to try and support both types at the moment.
