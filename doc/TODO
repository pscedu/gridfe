1. Remove Ping requirement before job submission.

------------ most likely not needed anymore --------------------
2. kdestroy needs to be called so that the TGT is removed before
the next authentication.. otherwise /tmp/krb5cc_$UID will remain
and the new TGT will be name /tmp/krb5cc_$UID_RANDOMFUBAR and auth
will fail.

3. auth should check  getenv("KRB5CCNAME") for a default kerberos
credential cache name. this way, we could possibly have mod_fum
store the most recent CCName in this env. if this is done we may 
not have to worry about calling kdestroy to destroy older tickets.

4. POSSIBLY A BIG PROBLEM HERE!!!!!
For gram jobs, there is already a way implemented to save the
stdout paramter of the RSL string, but there also needs to be a way
to save the current directory... this is important so that output
files can be opened and read in... oooo, but wait, will this
present a permissions problem with reading job data??? somehow we
need to make sure that read permission is enabled on the output files,
unless the files will be saved as apache, in which case we need to chmod
and possibly chown to set the proper user settings (on exit)...

5. Add configuration to apache to not permit SSLv2... should be
the command "SSLProtocol all -SSLv2" but figure out where it goes
(this should be a real quick fix)

6. Find out whether modfum needs to do anything special with ap_malloc
variables... supposedly apache does it's own garbage collection, but
do the variables need to be set to NULL so that it knows it can get
rid of them?? (kinda like java??? remove all references to them)
