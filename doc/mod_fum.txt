About Mod_Fum
=============
Mod_Fum (the Module for Free Utilization and Moderation through Kerberos)
was specificly designed for use with Grid Portal software.  Mod_Fum's purpose
is to provide the functionality of the command line tools "kinit", "kx509", 
and "kxlist -p" through apache. Mod_Fum will obtain a Kerberos Ticket,
a short term  X.509 Certificate, and a Globus Proxy for the user. These
credentials will be specific to the user, but readable only by apache (apache
becomes the sole owner). This allows web applications, such as portals, to
act on the users behalf.

Note: Mod_Fum should only be used in conjunction with Mod_SSL! Otherwise
Kerberos passwords will be transmitted in cleartext across the wire.


Mod_Fum Installation
====================

Requirements:
=============
1) Apache 2.X
2) Kerberos 5
3) kx509
	When building kx509 the configuration option
	--enable-libkx509 must be used.  mod_fum relies on the shared
	library libkx509.so to be in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or for libkx509.so
	to be properly installed, which the kx509 distribution does not
	provide installation targets for, and must be installed
	manually:

	# cp libkx509.so /usr/lib
	# ldconfig

	Note:
	The kx509 header file 'kx509.h' must also be present on the system
	to build mod fum.



Building Mod_Fum:
=================
1) Type: 'make' to compile the module
2) Then: 'make install' to install (using apsx) into apache

Other:
3) Type: 'make clean' to remove mod_fum and scratch files
for a fresh build.


Apache Configuration:
=====================
1) Add the following to your <Directory> tags in your 'httpd.conf' file
to enable Mod_Fum authentication:

	# Mod_Fum Authentication Requirements
	AuthName "GridFe Login"
	AuthType Basic
	SetHandler mod_fum_auth
	Require Valid-User

	# Use this for mod_ssl support (recommended!!)
	SSLRequireSSL
	SSLProtocol all -SSLv2
