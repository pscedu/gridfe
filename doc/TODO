Add configuration to Apache to not permit SSLv2.
	- should be the command "SSLProtocol all -SSLv2" but figure
	  out where it goes (this should be a real quick fix)

- Add job submission example suite/guide
- load rsl for job submit option
- add goto gridftp browser button to overview/index page
- move to jmk (java make) or even ant
- move MKDEP from defs.mk to local.mk
- job get output both stdout and stderr, not just stdout
- rename database field "host type" to "host gridftp type"
- see if kx509 can generate a full certificate from an undelegated gssapi
  auth credential (obtained from "negotiate auth" mechanism) with konqueror
  you cannot change the delegation parameter to gss_init_sec_context()
	- perhaps requires modifications to kx509 software itself

- fix ClassNotFoundException: gridfe.www.t
  when requesting gridfe.psc.edu/gridfe/gridfe/t
- revamp buildURL -- take an array of query string params which
  all get URL-escaped, use & instead of &amp;, and make sure resulting
  URLs are always HTML-escaped when being written to a page.
- add x509 cert to db to test globus-job-submit (job manager dependency,
  but also fails for "make test")
- add a "show more options" button which shows/hides advanced
  job submission options
- unhardcode all the ben stuff
- redo stop/go host status buttons
- add file rename functionality into gftp browser
