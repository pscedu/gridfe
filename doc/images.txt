The graphical layout of the pages consists of an image navigation menu.
This menu is comprised of images which describe and link to the various
other pages of GridFE.  There are general categories and sub-categories
of pages to choose from.

General category images are all the same except for the last one, which
produces a shadow that extends below its normal height parameter.  Sub-
category images are all the same except for the first one, which needs
to contain the shadow overlay from the general category image above it.
