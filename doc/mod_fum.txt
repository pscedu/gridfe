mod_fum Installation
====================

Requirements:
=============
1) Kerberos 5
2) kx509
	When building kx509 the configuration option
	--enable-libkx509 must be used.  mod_fum relies on the shared
	library libkx509.so to be in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or for libkx509.so
	to be properly installed, which the kx509 distribution does not
	provide installation targets for, and must be installed
	manually:

	# cp libkx509.so /usr/lib
	# ldconfig
