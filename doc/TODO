1. Remove Ping requirement before job submission.

2. kdestroy needs to be called so that the TGT is removed before
the next authentication.. otherwise /tmp/krb5cc_$UID will remain
and the new TGT will be name /tmp/krb5cc_$UID_RANDOMFUBAR and auth
will fail.

3. auth should check  getenv("KRB5CCNAME") for a default kerberos
credential cache name. this way, we could possibly have mod_fum
store the most recent CCName in this env. if this is done we may 
not have to worry about calling kdestroy to destroy older tickets.
