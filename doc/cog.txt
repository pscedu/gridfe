CoG 2.0-Pre Alpha Installation
==============================

CoG 2.0-Pre Alpha is required to build GridFe due to bugs
in CoG version 1.1 that were unable to be worked around.

Requirements:
=============

CoG 2.0-Pre Alpha can be obtained through cvs with the
following commands:

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.globus.org:/home/dsl/cog/CVS login
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.globus.org:/home/dsl/cog/CVS checkout cog
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.globus.org:/home/dsl/cog/CVS checkout -r jglobus-jgss jglobus
   
(see http://www-unix.globus.org/cog/java/2.0/main.html)


Building:
=========
(This assumes CoG cvs checkout located at /usr/java/cog-2.0)

1) Change to the Cog directory

[localhost]$ cd /usr/java/cog-2.0/cog

2) Modify classpath env variable to include necessary .jar files:
	a. rt.jar 	(/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_05/jre/lib/rt.jar)
	b. ldapsec.jar	(/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_05/jre/lib/ext/ldapsec.jar)
	c. ant.jar 	(/usr/share/java/ant.jar)

3) Build CoG (without jglobus src! it's not needed)

[localhost]$  ant && ant dist && ant jar


Setup:
======

Now that CoG is built make note the paths for the following files
needed in 'mk.defs' file for GridFe:

a. puretls.jar
b. cryptix32.jar
c. cryptix-asn1.jar
d. cog-jglobus.jar

NOTE: Easy solution to create 'lib' directory in /usr/java/cog-2.0
and symlink the above files there before modifying 'mk.defs'
